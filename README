# clj-htmlunit

In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. Also, a clojure
wrapper for htmlunit

## Usage

The default way I envisage the usage is to use the with-* macros. So you would do something like:

(with-client :ff3.6
  (with-page "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu"
    (with-element :by-id "Publication_history"
      (println (.asText *current-element*))
      (cause-madness *current-element*)
      ;; other evil things to the element
      )))

So basically a little DSL for dealing with html pages. You can still
access the objects normally withouth the with-* macros, or pass them
to the low level macro variants.

Pay attention that I am not mapping exactly to the htmlunit
classes. If you want something more specialized, dig directly into
objects.
